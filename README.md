Miscellaneous files to get my Blade Center and
PXE booting and installing without intervention.

* new_blade.sh
  Script to unpack and do local modifications
  to the installed system.

* bladefs
  This directory is misc local stuff that's is
  in a tarball and extracted in the installed
  system root at the very latest in the install
  procedure.

* debian-installer_amd64_boot-screens_adtxt.cfg
  My modified version of the debian-installer/amd64/boot-screens/adtxt.cfg
  from the http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/jessie/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz
  tarball.

* preseed_compute.cfg
  My preseed config file. Well, pretty much any
  way. It's been "cleaned" somewhat.
